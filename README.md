# Poker Hand Detector using YOLOv8

This project is a poker hand detector developed using YOLOv8, Python 3.11, and CUDA 11.8 toolkit. It utilizes the Playing Cards image dataset provided by Roboflow to train the model for detecting different poker hands.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is the Playing Cards image dataset by Roboflow, which can be accessed [here](https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- CUDA 11.8 toolkit

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/survivor-zik/yolo.git
   ```
2. Run YOLO over the dataset
